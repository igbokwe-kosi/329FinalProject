          <h2>Is Public Wi-Fi Safe?!</h2>
          <p>
            When we are out and about, we frequently need Wi-Fi for googling
            things like restaurant hours, Google Maps, responding to family
            members, and far more. Traditionally we would need to use data to
            access this information, but more and more stores are now getting
            public Wi-Fi with some requiring just an email, and some an account
            to connect to it. Despite the incredible convenience, are these safe
            to use? If not, what is the risk and what can we and society do to
            protect each other?
          </p>
          <p>
            But before we talk about those, we need to talk about what makes a
            network unsecure. The first is lack of encryption (explained in the
            next paragraph), weak network password (makes it easier for an
            attacker to sign in), and outdated software (importance explained on
            a different page). This makes it unsecure because it makes it easier
            for a bad actor to get in and get information. We’re gonna talk
            about some risks, sometimes how to fix the
          </p>
          <p>
            First, though, how can public Wi-Fi be risky? Well, if it is
            “unsecured”, or in other words if it has some security flaws. Some
            very common ones include lack of encryption (data going in and out
            isn’t scrambled), weak network passwords, and outdated software (bad
            guys tech may be better than the companies). Any of these issues can
            make a network much more susceptible to the bad guys, keeping these
            in mind we would like to talk about how a bad guy can get to you
            through a public Wi-Fi network if it is unsecured.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first risk is eavesdropping, many of the public Wi-Fi networks
            are not encrypted. This simply means that your data is changed to be
            unreadable to bad actors, and then decrypted once it is done being
            moved around. Because many of these networks are not encrypted those
            bad actors could read sensitive information like login credentials,
            personal messages and more. The solution could involve simply not
            signing in (boring), or more interestingly using a VPN, covered on a
            different page of our website!
