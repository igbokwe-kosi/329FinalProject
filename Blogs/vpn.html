          <h2>VPN’s</h2>

            HEY!! Welcome back, I can see you’re getting addicted to my wit and
            sense of humour. Anyway, VPN time! So, we’re gonna talk about what
            it is, the science behind it and some really good ones you can pay
            for!
          </p>
          <p>
            Ok VPN stands for Virtual Private Network, which allows you to
            create your own, non-physical secure network instead of using
            potentially (and probably) unsafe ones! What separates virtual and
            physical ones includes the lack of a physical body and how it is
            protecting your data. Physically speaking, it doesn’t have routers,
            and modems, and cables, and wires and hardware. And for protection
            instead of using firewalls and access controls it uses encryption.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, here’s a simple deep dive on encryption; first we need to
            understand 2 types of messages and how we encrypt one. Imagine you
            are passing messages between you and your friend Bob in class, but
            some punk named Eve keeps reading them. The plaintext is when you
            write “Hi Bob” and Eve can read “Hi Bob”. To stop this we convert
            out message to ciphertext, which is when you write “Hi Bob” and Eve
            can read “NOKW S” (enigma code). When Bob receives the message, he
            will know how to decrypt it back into “Hi Bob”. To encrypt we take
            the letters given to use and we change them up, and swap letters
            around and change the order of the alphabet, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s not truly important to understand how a VPN will encrypt the
            algorithm and change up our 1’s and 0’s, but it is important to
            understand why. We want to stop Eve from reading our data so we
            encrypt it and give Bob the key to unlock it that way while it is in
            transit no one else can figure it out.
          </p>
          <p>
            What are the risks of not using one, as getting one costs money, we
            need a good reason to do it. Well for one, if you use unsecured
            online banking then the bad guys could potentially read your data
            transfers which is bad. Another one is IP address finding, this is
            where an attacker could potentially expose where you are when they
            steal the data. It can also release other sensitive information, so
            just imagine the worst thing that is saved on your phone and now
            imagine some skeevy pervert getting it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here’s the best VPN’s for you (we didn’t compile this list we got it
            from the last item on the citation list), pure vpn, BitDefenderVPN,
            norton, ULTRAVPN, CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, atlasVPN, TotalVPN,
            Surfshark and NordVPN. These are the top ranked ones on the market,
            and the best ones a person could use! Personally I’ve heard great
            things about NordVPN but have yet to actually try a VPN (poor uni
            student activities).
