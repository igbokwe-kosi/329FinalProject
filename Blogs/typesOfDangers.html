          </p>

          <h4>Virus</h4>
          <p>
            A computer virus is the most common type of malware most people get.
            Computer viruses get hold of clean files and from there corrupts
            them and corrupts any other files that come in touch with them as
            well. Computer viruses do this by making copies of themselves and
            sticking them onto different computer programs and files. Once
            someone opens one of these infected files it spreads throughout your
            computer which creates problems as it can steal your personal
            information and stop your laptop from performing multiple everyday
            tasks making the computer useless. Think of a computer virus like a
            cold your computer can catch, just like how humans catch a cold they
            can spread their cold to others by sneezing or getting in close
            proximity of the infected human. Similar to computer virus it
            spreads itself by implementing and inserting code onto your computer
            files which damages your laptop. To help identify a computer virus
            can be easy if you're careful when browsing the web or downloading
            or opening softwares, just like you can be when you're out and about
            in the world you're cautious and careful. Some way to identify them
            is by not downloading just any software or opening and downloading
            files from an email to see if the sender of the email or the
            software you're downloading is from a person you trust and know.
            Websites that seem sketchy or have a bunch of pop ads that redirect
            you to different pages are also red flags and should avoid them as
            they can lead to a virus. Read reviews or videos to see what other
            people say and their experiences when downloading apps/programs. If
            something online seems too good to be true like free money by
            watching a video/ad or free movies or streams it's most likely a
            scam that will lead to a virus on your computer. Ways to prevent
            your computer from getting a virus is by downloading/installing
            antivirus tools such as Mcafee and keeping them updated at all
            times, run antivirus scans, don't use unsecure networks, think twice
            before clicking, create strong and secure passwords and also use a
            firewall.
          </p>

          <h4>Worms</h4>
          <p>
            A computer worm is like a virus they can corrupt and kill your
            computer memory or storage. A difference between the two is that
            worms can spread by themselves, they don't need to attach themselves
            to files or programs on your computer to spread. Worms make
            duplicates of themselves and spread instantly and quickly across
            many devices. Wormâ€™s fast pace and speed that they spread at can
            slow down bandwidth of your internet connection and can also slow
            down and crash your computer. To help avoid and prevent yourself
            from getting a computer worm you must first be able to identify how
            they look and the different ways/forms they come in. One way is by
            being careful with email and links and files that come with them
            only open or download the ones you believe are safe by knowing the
            person who sent you the email etc. Don't click on random ads that
            seem too good to be true, only download stuff that are from credible
            sources, download antivirus tool and have them updated at all time,
            and again create strong passwords have a firewall ready on your
            computer, don't just connect to any free WI-Fi and be careful when
            connecting to such, regularly backup your files and pictures as well
            in case of a attack. By implementing these steps and being cautious
            online it makes it harder for attackers to attack you and your
            computer.
          </p>

          <h4>Trojan horses</h4>
          <p>
            A trojan horse virus is like the same concept and attack method as
            the real trojan horse attack, Trojan horse virus can be seen and
            shown to a user as something they like or need. It may be appealing
            to them but in reality it's not something they expected because of
            this it will lead them into downloading certain stuff causing
            catastrophic damages to their computer. Trojan viruses can be
            usually found in emails or pop ups on sketchy websites, they often
            come as antivirus programs and pretend like they are real and legit
            and will help keep your computer safe but in reality it will cause
            much damage. To help spot these trojans one can avoid downloading
            sketchy software and clicking on links on email sent from
            individuals you don't know or can identify. Another way to avoid
            getting a trojan virus is by again downloading firewalls and
            antivirus software and making sure to always keep them updated.
            Following these steps can help avoid trojan virus and many other
            virus types as well.
          </p>

          <h4>Ransomware</h4>
          <p>
            Ransomware malware is a virus that acts like a virtual kidnapper,
            they take and lock your files and important information and to get
            such files back you would need to pay money or some sort of payment
            to get those files back. A way to identify this is if a message
            comes up on your screen asking for money is a ransomware attack, in
            this type of case unplug your computer and seek professional help.
            If you fall victim to this scam do not pay the attackers as it can
            lead to much more problems as they ask for personal information,
            card details, etc. Ways to prevent and protect yourself from a
            ransomware attack is by being careful and fully alert when opening
            and downloading content from emails. Downloading antivirus softwares
            and keeping them up to date. Keeping your system up to date. Backup
            important files. Taking these steps minimizes the chances of a
            ransomware attack and even if such an attack still happens your
            files are backed up.
          </p>

          <h4>Spyware</h4>
          <p>
            A spyware malware is something that steals your personal information
            without your knowledge or consent. This virus can also allow the

            does is it spams and fills your entire screen with unwanted ads.

            preferences. It may not seem harmful but it's still an invasion of
            privacy and can maybe down the road cause security/safety problems.

            ads. It can also be fixed by a good security/antivirus software.
          </p>

          <h4>Rootkits</h4>
          <p>

            have full control over your computer without your knowledge/consent.

            access to admin controls and they can also spy/monitor your
            activity. These attacks are hard to spot and if infected by one will
            lead to you either buying a new laptop or wiping your entire
            computer to get rid of them. Rootkit malware are usually conducted
            by the attackers sending out emails and sketchy downloads. Ways to
            prevent these attacks is by opening or downloading content that you
