          <h2>Why Should You Patch?</h2>
          <h3>By Seth Pullishy</h3>

          <p>
            Y’know how every morning your computer asks to update, and you say
            remind me tomorrow? This is why you should stop. We’re gonna tell
            you what a patch is, why they are important and what the risks of
            not updating could be.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, to start off, what is a patch? A patch is a kind of update that
            repairs a security flaw, imagine you own a chicken coop and there’s
            a hole in the side so now coyotes can get in. Well, you would
            naturally patch that hole with something. It is important to note
            that it’s not like fixing that hole and making it brand new,
            sometimes it can cause other issues, but it surely stops the
            attackers from using a guaranteed security flaw.
          </p>
          <p>
            I checked this is fair use under US copyright law as we are not
            selling this product
          </p>
          <p>
            So, now that we know what it is and why it could be important, where
            do we find out where to do it. Well, Windows and Mac will give you
            an update prompt and some of the more popular Linux’s even
            automatically update for you so that’s simple. Most software I have
            ever used also gives a prompt or doesn’t let you use it until
            there’s an update so that is convenient!
          </p>
          <p>
            Almost finally, what are the risks of not updating? Well, time for
            another strange analogy! Imagine your computer is a castle, and your
            moat guy keeps telling you it needs an update, the crocodiles are
            old, the edges aren’t steep enough it is a risk! But you ignore him,
            and then one day the enemy comes. They reach the walls and can cross
            the simple moat and come in and kill you. Well, that is what we want
            to prevent, we don’t want cyberattacks of any kind, and leaving any
            vulnerabilities means these attacks become more likely. People could
            try and attack the same system flaw for months or years so over time
            you are more likely to get attacked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I wanna tell you what EOL software is, EOL stands for
            end-of-life, and it simply means that the developers are done with
            it. They aren’t gonna update it anymore, which means if a flaw is
            discovered (which over time becomes more and more likely), there
            will be no one to fix it. Our very last info citation is a site
            where you can search to see if any of your software has EOL’d.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be safe, and make sure you upgrade your moat as much as possible,
            insert cheesy pun here.
