          <h2>Is Public Wi-Fi Safe?!</h2>
          <h3>By Seth Pullishy</h3>
          <div class="divisor"></div>
          <p>
            When we are out and about, we frequently need Wi-Fi for googling
            things like restaurant hours, Google Maps, responding to family
            members, and far more. Traditionally we would need to use data to
            access this information, but more and more stores are now getting
            public Wi-Fi with some requiring just an email, and some an account
            to connect to it. Despite the incredible convenience, are these safe
            to use? If not, what is the risk and what can we and society do to
            protect each other?
          </p>
          <p>
            But before we talk about those, we need to talk about what makes a
            network unsecure. The first is lack of encryption (explained in the
            next paragraph), weak network password (makes it easier for an
            attacker to sign in), and outdated software (importance explained on
            a different page). This makes it unsecure because it makes it easier
            for a bad actor to get in and get information. We’re gonna talk
            about some risks, sometimes how to fix the
          </p>
          <p>
            First, though, how can public Wi-Fi be risky? Well, if it is
            “unsecured”, or in other words if it has some security flaws. Some
            very common ones include lack of encryption (data going in and out
            isn’t scrambled), weak network passwords, and outdated software (bad
            guys tech may be better than the companies). Any of these issues can
            make a network much more susceptible to the bad guys, keeping these
            in mind we would like to talk about how a bad guy can get to you
            through a public Wi-Fi network if it is unsecured.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first risk is eavesdropping, many of the public Wi-Fi networks
            are not encrypted. This simply means that your data is changed to be
            unreadable to bad actors, and then decrypted once it is done being
            moved around. Because many of these networks are not encrypted those
            bad actors could read sensitive information like login credentials,
            personal messages and more. The solution could involve simply not
            signing in (boring), or more interestingly using a VPN, covered on a
            different page of our website!
          </p>

          <p>
            Another risk is fake networks, let’s say that you’re going to
            Walmart and see two different networks: “Walmart Guest” and
            “WALMART-GUEST”. Flip a coin and sign into one. If you choose wrong,
            a cybercriminal now can intercept your data. This is called a
            man-in-the-middle attack. If you would like to avoid this, try and
            connect to networks who require a password given at the front desk
            or once again use a VPN.
          </p>
          <p>
            Weak network password is pretty self-explanatory, ever try to guess
            the password at your friend's house, and it’s literally just their
            name. Now imagine a large shop doing that, and it becomes a large
            target for bad actors. Once signed in (on the administrator side),
            they can change things as they please.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have one final one for you, session hijacking, you sign in on
            your account and the attacker takes over and pretends to be you!
            This is of course far more dangerous if you’re in your bank for
            example, but nobody wants any of their data taken. If they do this,
            you may not know what they are doing with your account. There’re a
            few ways to protect yourself (check out our Top 10 Ways to Keep
            Yourself Safe), but one big one is policing your cookies. Simply
            put, a cookie remembers who you are and what the website is allowed
            to do, so you maybe you want no cookies active (websites ask for
            permission when you connect) so that the attacker cannot use them
            against you. You can also always sign out and use 2-factor
            authentication.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may be wondering why a network would be unsecure. Like why would
            a company have these risks, there are a few reasons. Number one is
            change is hard and expensive so a company may not be motivated to
            update their system if it has been working so far. They may just be
            complacent and not believe it is important or they may be
            uneducated. Some of these issues are business-specific and you can
            try to pressure your favourites businesses, but the best solution is
            a VPN. These will protect your data. You can see our Best VPN’s of
            2023 page for our suggestions, but we will always encourage you to
            do your own research.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I’m sure you’ve noticed this is a group issue, businesses and
            yourself, if they have safety procedures, we also need to be safe.
            If you wanna learn more we have several other pages, some have been
            name-dropped in here, but we will always encourage you to surf our
            webpage! We want to end off by scaring you straight. According to
            Forbes, they did a survey in which 40% of people involved had their
            data compromised through public Wi-Fi. Isn’t that scary. That man
            below wants your data. Don’t let him get it.
