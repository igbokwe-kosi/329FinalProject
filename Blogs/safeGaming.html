          <h2>How to Stay Safe While Gaming</h2>

            Do you like video games? Good. Are you ever worried about
            potentially giving your info to strangers, or accidentally risking
            your data? Also, good. Fear creates preparation and preparation is
            always a good thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, when gaming here are the risks: doxing, leaving other data
            visible and data selling. First, we’ll talk about doxing, this is
            when someone releases private data, name, address, phone number
            etc., of someone online. All without the user's permission. This
            happens in several ways, checking the username on other websites,
            phishing, stalking, tracking IP addresses, packet sniffing, and data
            brokers. Now I’m gonna explain each of these risks. The first is
            when you use your username in multiple places, so they just type it
            in on Instagram, or discord, or whatever. Phishing is about sending
            you a message with some hazardous material in it (check out our
            malware topic!). Stalking can involve finding your information
            through social media and y’know doing general stalking (this is
            bad). Tracking IP addresses is more interesting, each computer has a
            unique IP address, they can use that try to discover more
            information. So how do they find the IP address, if you’re on an
            internet forum the IP address is saved with your account so the
            moderators can see who you really are, so a hacker could potentially
            get it from there. If you’ve left a comment they could get it
            through that as well. This is not to say that it is EASY, but it is
            indeed possible. I actually know people who personally were doxed
            when playing games, and it truly is scary (for them). Some of these
            involve common sense, some may involve the police and some certainly
            will involve VPN’s to solve (in the order laid out above).
          </p>
          <p>
            Continuing into packet sniffing, this is effectively just when a
            hacker intercepts your internet data through some means. Once they
            have that data, they can try looking for anything you send over the
            internet, texts, banking info, etc. This can be combatted
            effectively with a VPN as it will encrypt your data so they cannot
            read it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, is a data broker: a company that sells data. All websites
            with cookies keep information about you, because it is incredibly
            useful for them and convenient for you. It remembers who you are, so
            you don’t always have to sign in, or keeps stuff in your cart, etc.
            However, some companies are more than happy to sell your data for
            money to anyone who will buy it. So, if they sell it, why couldn’t
            some weirdo buy it right? Data brokers are a serious issue and the
            best solution to them is probably legislative, that way companies
            cannot legally sell your data away. I believe the US tends to have
            looser laws than most so if you’re an American please be careful!
          </p>
          <p>
            The last bit I wanna mention is the history of doxing. It has been
            around since the 90’s, before the internet and was used to reveal
            information about some hackers. It became very well known over a
            decade ago when many KKK members were doxed. As well, the murderer
            of Cecil the Lion was doxed and when the Boston Marathon Bombing the
            internet tried to find the bombers, but just led to innocent people
            tragically being harassed.
