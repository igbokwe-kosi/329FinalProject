          <h2>Top 10 Ways to Stay Safe</h2>
          <h3>By Seth Pullishy</h3>

          <p>
            The internet is a fun place, but also really scary in other parts
            (terrorists have webpages for example), and those scary places can
            colour your interpretation of the rest of the web. So, we wanted to
            give you a list of 10 things you can do to protect yourself, your
            computer, your data and your loved ones. Note: this list is not in
            any particular order.
          </p>
          <h4>10. Never use personal information</h4>

          <p>
            This is a big one when interacting with people. It’s recommended
            that you avoid using usernames or passwords that identify you. We
            don’t wanna use a username that is just your name, we don’t want to
            be tied to anything online. Obviously if you have Instagram for
            example, you probably use your name and have photos of yourself, but
            you also probably only communicate with friends and family. However,
            on sites like Reddit, YouTube or your favourite cooking blog you
            probably don’t need to be identifiable. Most of the people you
            interact with don’t know and shouldn’t know you. To stay protected
            it is recommended that you also never share that information. Don’t
            tell anyone where you live, or who you are. This is because you
            don’t know them, and they could be a bad actor. To stay safe, your
            real life and virtual identities should be distinct, so that people
            cannot look at your name or upload history and figure out who you
            are.
          </p>
          <h4>9. Stay mainstream</h4>
          <p>
            Do you know where the best place to hide a body is? The second page
            of Google. No one has ever looked there. The internet is VAST, so
            much so that Google is ONLY 5%!!!! That other 95% is like the
            jungles of South America, largely unexplored and probably
            unforgiving, so why go there? It is best to stay in trustworthy
            sites, the high traffic ones, not because they are perfect, but
            because we know who owns them and who runs them. There is really no
            need to dive into the depths, and if you do you just run the risk of
            getting more malware. The photo is Bad Bunny I believe, but showed
            up on a stock footage site when I typed dark web and I think he
            looks cool.
          </p>

          <h4>8. Stay organized</h4>
          <p>
            By this, I mean account organization. The average person has 240
            accounts with a password (according to Dashlane.com) and that amount
            is surely unmanageable but there are programs you can use to help.
            We certainly recommend a password manager, and if you have a Google
            or Gmail account you have one built in. These services will remember
            your username and password so that you don’t have to. By keeping
            yourself organized you will hopefully be able to keep stronger
            passwords instead of the same password 240 times, and the more you
            have the safer you are.
          </p>
          <h4>7. Two-Factor Authentication</h4>
          <p>
            Two-factor authentication refers to having to use two pieces of ID
            to sign-in. Most commonly it is a username/password and an SMS text
            message. This is better because an attacker needs to work harder to
            get the second piece, but certainly not perfect. These messages can
            be intercepted and used by an attacker (explained in the
            hackcontrol.org link), but it is more work for an attacker and
            therefore better. It is important to not get a false sense of
            security though, and to stay on guard.
          </p>
          <h4>6. Avoid strangers</h4>
          <p>
            Stranger danger is still an important phrase these days and maybe
            even more important in the modern era. You don’t know who that
            person is, so it may be best to avoid them, and please, PLEASE do
            not give them personal info. A stranger could dox you, which is when
            a stranger posts private information about you like an IP address or
            where you live, which can be done through hacking so try not to
            engage with individuals you don’t know when possible.
          </p>

          <h4>5. Strong passwords</h4>
          <p>
            Passwords! So vital. In this case we’re just gonna refer you to how
            to create a strong password (also check out our password game), but
            we are gonna tell you why. If you have a weak password, somebody
            could sign in as you and pretend to be you! That’s bad! By keeping a
            strong password, you can keep a strong lock on the gate to your
            digital identity.
          </p>
          <h4>4. Stay updated</h4>
          <p>
            This means software updating, when a company releases a patch, it
            could have very vital security features being updated because a leak
            was found. If you don’t update it, then you are potentially leaving
            yourself vulnerable to bad actors. We recommend updating all of your
            software immediately. The most important being your OS, in the
            Windows update or whatever Apple uses to update (Windows superiority
            gang).
          </p>
          <h4>3. Keep family safe</h4>
          <p>
            We want to remind you to tell your loved ones how to stay safe. All
            of these apply to them and doing this could also keep you safe. If a
            loved one gets hacked, then the attacker may use that trusted
            account to send you malware to compromise your account. This
            happened to me, buddy’s Instagram was hacked, and the hacker tried
            to get me to sign up for a gift card or something. So, if he was
            able to keep that hacker away then I would never have been given the
            chance to be compromised. Keep your people safe!
          </p>

          <h4>2. Don’t click on popups (usually)</h4>
          <p>
            If you get a weird email with a link don’t click on it. If you’re on
            a website and you get a sudden pop –up that says “HACKERS ARE
            CLOSING IN DOWNLOAD THIS TO STOP THEM” don’t click on it. Also never
            download something from an untrusted source, which to be fair, is
            most of them. Popups can give you a virus by downloading them so
            don’t do it!
          </p>
          <h4>1. Get a VPN</h4>
          <p>
            This one is big, and we are gonna go into depth on VPNs on the page
            labeled “What IS a VPN?”. The main purpose of this is to mask your
            identity so that no other individual can see who you are. In my
            opinion, the most important point to understand here is how it
            prevents those doxing attacks from earlier (when someone leaks
            information about you like an IP address). It masks your IP address
            so an attacker cannot see it, and that is a great step to preserving
            your identity.
          </p>

            Summary There are many things you can do, and we encourage you to do
            them. If there is a technological aspect you want more on, keep
            exploring our website so we can teach you about the math and the
            science!
