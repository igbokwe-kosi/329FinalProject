          <h4>The Future in Computing Technology</h4>
          <p>
            Over the years, computing power has advanced significantly, defying
            initial expectations. With the introduction of the integrated
            circuit or microchip, a few years later, a new law was founded,
            called Moore's Law. This law states that every two years, the number
            of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles, doubling the
            computer’s performance. A transistor is a tiny electronic device
            that acts like an on/off switch, controlling the flow of 1s and 0s
            in a computer to process information. Moore’s law has remained true
            since 1965, resulting in microchips now featuring billions of
            densely packed transistors.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the continued effort to make transistors smaller, a crucial
            factor in Moore's Law, is reaching physical limits. The spatial
            constraints between transistors have become so small that further
            size reduction is challenging. This development implies an impending
            obsolescence of Moore's Law. The critical question emerges: How will
            the industry keep on improving computing power when the physical
            space for additional transistors on a microchip is rapidly
            diminishing?
          </p>
          <h4>Introduction to Quantum Computers</h4>
          <p>
            The industry has been exploring diverse paths for advancing
            computing power, with Quantum Computers emerging as a promising
            recent development. Quantum computers utilize principles from
            quantum mechanics to perform complex calculations beyond the
            capabilities of traditional computers. Unlike classical computers,
            quantum computers employ quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in
            two states simultaneously through a phenomenon known as
            "superposition." This unique property allows quantum computers to
            process and store information more extensively.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to superposition, quantum computers use another quantum
            mechanics concept called "entanglement." This occurs when a pair of
            electrons or protons become interconnected, establishing a mutual
            dependence regardless of their spatial separation. In the realm of
            quantum computers, entanglement manifests as all qubits being
            entangled, creating interdependence among their states. As a result,
            these entangled qubits can communicate with each other
            instantaneously, overcoming any conflicts arising from spatial
            distances.
          </p>
          <h4>How will Quantum Computers Affect the Modern World?</h4>
          <p>
            Quantum computers, much like classical ones did in the past, will
            very possibly redefine computing's limits. The potential computing
            power they harbor could mark the pinnacle of computing power. This
            shift also implies that encryption algorithms may soon become
            obsolete. The essential questions are: How exactly will encryption
            methods become obsolete? And, in what ways will the computational
            power of quantum computers influence different encryption types?
          </p>
          <p>
            In the near future, it's likely that quantum computers will have
            enough power to make current encryption methods outdated. But how?
            Quantum computers excel at processing large numbers rapidly,
            surpassing classical supercomputers. Shor's algorithm, specifically
            designed for quantum computers, enables efficient factorization of
            large numbers. While the widely used RSA encryption algorithm
            currently remains secure, the potential threat comes from the rapid
            data deciphering capabilities of quantum computers. This capability
            may cause RSA and similar encryption methods to become obsolete
            soon. Anticipating the superior computational capabilities of
            quantum computers, factorizing these large numbers could take mere
            hours with a 4,000 qubit quantum computer, a task that would require
            classical supercomputers millions of years to accomplish. This
            implies that someone with a quantum computer could potentially
            access your bank account within hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the rise of Quantum Computers, it's clear that new algorithms
            will be developed to match the computational power of these systems,
            yet, as always, the captivating question persists: How?
          </p>
          <h4>The Development of New Algorithms</h4>
          <p>
            The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has
            unveiled four cryptographic algorithms designed to resist the
            potential threat posed by quantum computers. These algorithms,
            although still in development, have a mathematical foundation that
            makes it challenging for both quantum and classical computers to
            decrypt. While they are not finalized, these algorithms represent a
            significant step in creating tools that can withstand the
            computational power of quantum computers.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to NIST's algorithm development, there is also an act
            called the Endless Frontiers Act that includes 100 billion dollars
            in federal funding to support quantum and post-quantum encryptions.
            This funding aims to prepare our modern world for the potential
            impact of quantum computers in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Quantum computers are bound to reshape the modern digital landscape,
            prompting significant changes in cybersecurity. The key question is:
            When will quantum computers reach the required level of power to be
            a threat?
          </p>
          <h4>When Will Quantum Computers Become a Thing?</h4>

          <p>
            Current quantum computers lack the computational power to be a
            threat to our digital security. Presently, these computers don't
            possess enough qubits to be sufficiently powerful. According to
            Rose's law, similar to Moore's law, the quantum computer's qubit
            count doubles every 2 years. IBM's quantum computer Osprey currently
            leads with 433 qubits. However, a challenge arises for all quantum
            computers as some qubits are utilized for error correction, reducing
            the number of qubits available for calculations. Breaking RSA
            encryption in hours would require 4,000 qubits. If Rose's law holds,
            as Moore's law did for over 50 years, we can anticipate quantum
            computers surpassing 4,000 qubits in 6 to 8 years, leading to a
            redefined algorithmic landscape.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Apart from Threats: What are the Positive Changes Coming from
            Quantum Computers?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Quantum computers were not designed to break modern encryptions but
            to revolutionize the way we see computers in our present day.
            Quantum computers will transform the medical industry by simulating
            molecular-level processes with exceptional accuracy. These
            simulations offer a faster and more precise environment for future
            medical studies and testing compared to real-world scenarios. Beyond
            medicine, quantum computers' precise simulations can benefit
            industries like electric cars. The accurate simulations made
            possible by quantum computers could lead to the creation of safer,
            easier-to-recycle, and more energy-dense batteries for electric cars
            using new materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            The computational power of a quantum computer doesn't just help us
            create detailed simulations; it also allows us to build more
            advanced machine-learning programs. Quantum computers process data
            faster, enhancing their ability for better pattern recognition,
            predictions, and decision-making algorithms.
          </p>
          <p>
            The arrival of Quantum Computers marks a significant shift, not just
            in the digital landscape but in our everyday reality. Quantum
            computers are here to stay, and the influence they'll wield in the
            future will be even more impactful than we might currently realize.
